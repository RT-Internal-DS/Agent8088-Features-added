"""When the installer offers the setup wizard.

Setup used to run only on a fresh install. Every run after the first printed
"Existing installation updated - skipping first-run setup", which left no way
to change a model, endpoint or workspace through the installer at all -- the
one run that offered the wizard was the run before you knew you needed it.

The wizard reads the existing config and offers each stored value back as the
default, so re-running it is not destructive: pressing Enter through the
prompts leaves the file as it was.

As in test_installer_progress, the installer body is never executed. Only the
function definitions are lifted from the parsed AST, so nothing here can clone
a repo, create a venv, or launch the real agent. Reaching the wizard is proved
by the message emitted when the executable is absent, which the skip path never
gets far enough to print.
