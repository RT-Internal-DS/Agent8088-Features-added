Agent8088 is a local-first agent for real work: it reads files, runs tools, researches the web, and can make changes only within a permission system you control. Run it against local Ollama or a hosted OpenAI-compatible model, use it from the terminal or a messaging gateway, and extend it with MCP servers, skills, and focused sub-agents.

---

## What it does

| Capability | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| **Use the model you want** | 12 built-in provider profiles, local Ollama, OpenRouter, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Configure fallback models for retryable provider failures. |
| **Work safely by default** | `readonly` is the default. One-time approvals, path zones, credential protection, SSRF and egress controls, command allowlists, and an audit trail are enforced in code. |
| **Plan before changing things** | `/plan` lets the agent investigate first, present a plan for approval, then carry it out. Optional audits use a read-only sub-agent to verify mutating work. |
| **Delegate without losing context** | Five restricted sub-agent profiles handle exploration, research, coding, verification, and general-purpose work in separate runs. |
| **Use tools without lock-in** | Built-in tools for files, shell, web research, browser access, scheduling, Git, sandboxed code, CLI-Anything, and more. Connect external MCP servers or expose Agent8088's safe tools to Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor. |
| **Remember across sessions** | Durable facts about you and your projects are learned from finished turns and recalled automatically, using hybrid keyword + semantic search over a local SQLite store. Nothing leaves your machine. |
| **Stay in your workflow** | Use the interactive CLI or run a gateway for Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, and email. Sessions and approvals follow the same engine and permission layer. |
| **Run contained commands** | Native OS sandboxing is preferred, with Docker as a fallback. Network access from sandboxed commands is off unless you allow it. |
| **Keep research current** | Search can use SearXNG, Tavily, Exa, or the bundled keyless DDGS fallback, with date-aware queries and the same network controls as every other outbound request. |

## Quick start

### Install the development branch

**macOS, Linux, or WSL2**

```sh
curl -fsSL --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RT-Internal-DS/Agent8088-Features-added/development/install.sh | AGENT8088_BRANCH=development bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
$env:AGENT8088_BRANCH = "development"; iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RT-Internal-DS/Agent8088-Features-added/development/install.ps1)
```

The installer provisions an isolated Python environment, installs the global `agent8088` command, and can run the setup wizard. No administrator access is required for the base install.

**What the installer provisions automatically:**

| Component | Linux / macOS | Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core agent (chat, tools, MCP, search) | yes | yes |
| Gateway adapters (Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram) | yes | yes |
| Playwright Chromium (`browse_page`) | yes | yes |
| Node.js 22 + WhatsApp bridge npm deps | yes | yes (portable, no admin) |
| Native sandbox runtime | yes (auto-setup) | hint only — needs an elevated terminal |

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon & Intel) | Supported | `install.sh` |
| Ubuntu / Debian / Fedora / Arch (x64, arm64) | Supported | `install.sh` |
| WSL2 | Supported | `install.sh`; clone with LF line endings, not CRLF |
| Windows 10 (1903+) / 11, in Windows Terminal | Supported | `install.ps1` |
| Windows Server, legacy Console Host, PowerShell ISE | Not supported | needs a modern terminal host — see `install.ps1`'s terminal check |
| Alpine / other non-glibc Linux | Best-effort | works if bash, curl-or-wget, and Python 3.10+ are present |
| Corporate proxy (`HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`) | Supported | both installers honor standard proxy env vars |

After installing, start `agent8088` and run `/doctor [--fix]` to verify your setup, or
`/dump` to produce a bundle for a bug report.

The `[dev]` extra (pytest, ruff, pip-audit) is **not** installed — run `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` if you need the test suite.

### Configure and run

```sh
agent8088 --setup            # choose a provider, model, workspace, and search backend
agent8088                    # start the interactive agent
```

The setup wizard stores API keys in `~/.agent8088/.env` rather than `config.txt`. Start with a local Ollama model or select a hosted provider; the agent can switch models later with `/model` or `/models`.

> **Windows only:** the native sandbox runtime needs an elevated terminal to provision its restricted account + WFP egress filter. After install, open an elevated PowerShell and run `agent8088 --sandbox-setup`. On Linux and macOS the installer runs this automatically.

### A few useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent8088` | Start an interactive session. |
| `agent8088 --uninstall` | Remove the install dir, config, and env vars. |
| `agent8088 --gateway-setup` | Configure Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, or email. |
| `agent8088 --gateway` | Run the messaging gateway. |
| `agent8088 --mcp-serve` | Expose Agent8088's safe tools over MCP stdio. |
| `/plan <task>` | Research, propose a plan, and wait for your approval before mutations. |
| `/capabilities` | Show the live tool, MCP, sandbox, skill, sub-agent, and guardrail configuration. |
| `/cli-anything <task>` | Find, install, run, build, refine, test, or validate an application CLI through the experimental CLI-Anything integration. |
| `/doctor [--fix]` | Check local setup and report likely problems; `--fix` repairs a broken web-search install. |
| `/dump` | Write a redacted diagnostic bundle to disk, for sharing in a bug report. |

## How Agent8088 stays in control

Agent8088 has three permission modes:

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **`readonly`** *(default)* | Read and inspect safely; request a one-time approval for writes, network access, scheduling, or non-safe shell commands. |
| **`full-auto`** | Work without per-action prompts inside the configured workspace. The always-on safety floor still applies. |
| **`plan-only`** | Research and present a plan first; approved work then uses the regular permission path. |

Some actions are blocked in every mode: credential paths, shell startup-file writes, destructive Git operations such as `push` and `reset --hard`, and system-prompt exfiltration. See the [security guide](docs/wiki/03-permissions-and-security.md) for the exact boundaries and configuration.

### CLI-Anything integration *(experimental)*

Agent8088 can use the [HKUDS CLI-Anything](https://github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything)
ecosystem without turning it into a second agent. Agent8088 remains responsible
for planning, permissions, sandboxing, and verification; application-specific
`cli-anything-*` commands run as subordinate adapters.

```text
/cli-anything find an existing CLI for image editing
/cli-anything use the GIMP harness to create a 1024x1024 project
/cli-anything build a harness for ./my-application
```

The bundled skill is lazy-loaded. CLI-Hub itself is installed only after first
use and approval, into an environment isolated from Agent8088's own Python
packages. Automatic package management is initially restricted to reviewed
Python harness entries; public npm, uv, bundled, and generic shell installers
remain visible for manual review. After installing a harness, Agent8088 loads
its packaged `SKILL.md` before execution so application-specific prerequisites
and command guidance remain available without eagerly expanding the prompt.

## CLI and messaging quick reference

The CLI and gateway share the same agent loop, session model, tool registry, and permission checks.

| Action | CLI | Messaging gateway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start a conversation | `agent8088` | Run `agent8088 --gateway`, then message an authorized account. |
| Start fresh or resume work | `/new`, `/sessions`, `/resume` | Per-chat and per-thread sessions persist automatically. |
| Change the model | `/model <provider:model>` or `/models` | `/model <provider:model>` |
| Inspect capabilities | `/capabilities` | `/capabilities` |
| Approve an action | Interactive terminal prompt | `/approve`, `/approve session`, or `/deny`; Discord also provides buttons. |
| Manage MCP servers | `/mcp`, `/mcp add`, `/mcp reload` | Available through the shared agent where appropriate. |
