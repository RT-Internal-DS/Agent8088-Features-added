# Configuration

[← Wiki index](README.md)

`config.txt` is a flat `key=value` file with `#` comments — no YAML, no nesting.
Written with mode `0600`.

**Location**, in resolution order:

1. `$AGENT8088_CONFIG` if set
2. `~/.agent8088/config.txt`
3. `%LOCALAPPDATA%/agent8088/config.txt` (Windows)
4. the packaged `src/agent8088/config.txt` as a last-resort default

Secrets do **not** belong here — see [API keys](#api-keys-and-the-env-store).

## Paths and workspace

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_paths` | `.` | Roots the agent may touch at all; `.` is the launch workspace. Anything outside is refused before any other check. |
| `project_root` | cwd | Base for relative paths. |
| `shell_cwd` | cwd | Working directory for shell commands. |
| `no_prompt_paths` | (empty) | Writes here are auto-approved, no prompt. |
| `prompt_paths` | `.` | Writes here require per-action approval. |
| `blocked_paths` | (empty) | Writes here are **always** refused, even in full-auto. |
| `read_paths` | (empty) | If set, reads outside these escalate. |

The three write zones are checked in order: blocked → no-prompt → prompt. See
[Permissions & Security](03-permissions-and-security.md#write-path-zones).

## Model and providers

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `default_provider` | Which provider to use when none is specified. |
| `provider.<name>.base_url` | OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| `provider.<name>.model` | Model id. |
| `provider.<name>.api_key_env` | Name of the env var / `.env` entry holding the key. **Preferred.** |
| `provider.<name>.api_key` | Literal key. Legacy — migrated to `.env` on first run. |
| `provider.<name>.api_mode` | `openai` (default) or `litellm`. |
| `fallback_models` | Comma-separated `provider:model` chain, tried on 429/503/connection errors. |
| `context_window` | Token budget for history trimming. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Per-request timeout (default `120`). |

Sampling: `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty` (temperature is a runtime
setting — `/temp`). Details in [Model Providers](05-model-providers.md).

## Security

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_sensitive_files` | (empty) | Escape hatch — comma-separated exact paths to exempt; relative paths resolve from the workspace. |
| `deny_commands` | (empty) | Shell commands to refuse (fnmatch globs). Refused in every mode. |
| `allow_commands` | (empty) | If set, the **only** shell commands permitted (fnmatch globs). `deny_commands` still wins, and no allowlist re-enables the unrecoverable floor. |
| `readonly_safe_commands` | (built-in list) | Commands treated as safe inspection in readonly mode. |
| `ssrf_allow_hosts` | `127.0.0.1,localhost,192.168.3.67:8888` | Temporary LAN deployment allowlist for the shared SearXNG; replace before public distribution. |
| `web_search_provider` | `searxng` | Temporary LAN deployment pin; replace before public distribution. |
| `web_search_no_prompt` | `1` | Temporary LAN no-prompt opt-in; only pinned, allowlisted private SearXNG is permitted. |
| `search_base_url` | `http://192.168.3.67:8888/search?q=` | Temporary LAN SearXNG endpoint; replace before public distribution. `https://` is required for public hosts. |
| `search_date_augmentation` | `1` | Append the current year (or month, for "today"/"this week" questions) to a search query that means "as of now" and names no year of its own. Set `0` to send queries exactly as the model wrote them. |
| `web_search_results` | `5` | Results per search (max 20). |
| `ssrf_allow_private` | `0` | `1` opens the entire private network. Prefer the allowlist. |
| `allowed_domains` | (empty) | If set, the **only** public hosts the agent may reach. Empty means all are reachable. |
| `blocked_domains` | (empty) | Public hosts the agent may never reach. Wins over `allowed_domains`. |
| `max_command_chars` | `16384` | Commands longer than this are refused rather than analysed. |
| `audit_log` | `0` | `1` appends one redacted JSON line per gated tool decision. Turn this on for any gateway deployment. |
| `audit_log_path` | `<data dir>/audit.jsonl` | Where the audit trail is written (mode 0600). |
| `audit_max_detail` | `512` | Truncation length for the audit `detail` field. |
| `model_telemetry` | `0` | `1` records local metadata-only model-call health events. |
| `model_telemetry_path` | `<data dir>/model-telemetry.jsonl` | Local telemetry path (mode 0600). |

Domain matching is dot-anchored, so `allowed_domains=example.com` permits
`docs.example.com` but **not** `evilexample.com`.

Both domain lists are checked *before* the SSRF DNS lookup: a host the policy
already rejects is never resolved, so the attempt does not reach that domain's
nameserver.

## Approvals

Flat keys rather than a nested block, so every approval setting is greppable.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `denial_breaker_threshold` | `3` | Consecutive denials before the request stops and reports instead of retrying. `0` disables. |
| `cron_mode` | `deny` | What an **unattended** run does at an approval gate. `deny` refuses and tells the model to report it; `approve` treats the gate as granted. Neither touches the always-on floor. |
| `destructive_slash_confirm` | `1` | `/reset` and `/clear` ask before discarding a conversation. |
| `mcp_reload_confirm` | `1` | `/mcp reload` asks before dropping the tool cache. |

There is deliberately no separate "approval mode" setting.
[`--mode` / `permission_mode`](03-permissions-and-security.md#the-three-permission-modes)
already decides what is gated; a second axis that could also wave a gate through
would mean `readonly` plus one other key silently behaves like `full-auto`.

Scheduled runs created by `schedule_task` set `AGENT8088_UNATTENDED=1` themselves,
so `cron_mode` applies without extra setup. The variable is read once at startup,
not per call.

## Sandbox

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sandbox_backend` | `auto` | `auto` → native, then Docker. `native` or `docker` can force one backend; there is no unsandboxed fallback. |
| `sandbox_runtime_version` | pinned | Version of the native runtime to install. |
| `sandbox_allowed_domains` | (empty) | Domains reachable from inside the sandbox. |
| `docker_image` / `docker_network` | | Docker fallback settings. |

## Gateway

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `slack_enabled` / `whatsapp_enabled` / `discord_enabled` | `0` | Enable a channel. Only one at a time via the wizard. |
| `slack_allowed_users` etc. | (empty) | Comma-separated user ids permitted per platform. **Empty means nobody** — fail-closed. |
| `strict_platform_allowlist` | `1` | Refuses an id listed under a *different* platform's line. Set `0` only as a temporary migration aid. |
| `gateway_permission_mode` | `readonly` | `readonly` routes writes to chat approval; `edit` disables prompts. |
| `gateway_rate_limit_per_min` | `20` | Per-user messages per minute, slash commands included. `0` disables. |
| `whatsapp_mode` | `self-chat` | `self-chat` or `bot`. |
| `whatsapp_session_dir` | | Baileys session directory. |
| `whatsapp_bridge_port` | `3000` | Local bridge port. |

See [Messaging Gateway](08-messaging-gateway.md).

## MCP

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp_server_allow_writes` | `0` | `1` exposes `write_file` over `--mcp-serve`. Writes are **unattended** — MCP has no approval channel. |

MCP *servers you connect to* are configured in `mcp.json`, not here. See
[MCP](07-mcp.md).

## Limits

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `max_read_bytes` | Cap on a single file read. |
| `max_http_bytes` | Cap on an HTTP response. |
| `max_tool_output_bytes` | Cap on tool output fed back to the model. |
| `max_tool_timeout_seconds` | Hard ceiling for one tool call (default `300`). |
| `max_image_bytes` | Cap on an image attachment. |
| `browser_timeout_ms` | `browse_page` timeout. |

### Turn budget

`max_turns` bounds how many *rounds* a request takes. These bound what those
rounds may consume — a plan or subagent chain can burn a lot inside a small
number of rounds. All default to `0`, meaning disabled.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `max_turn_seconds` | `0` | Wall-clock ceiling for one request. |
| `plan_mode_timeout_seconds` | `300` | Default wall-clock ceiling used in plan mode when `max_turn_seconds` is unset. |
| `plan_mode_retry_limit` | `2` | Invalid mutation attempts allowed before plan mode stops safely. |
| `max_turn_tokens` | `0` | Token ceiling (input + output) for one request. |
| `max_turn_cost_usd` | `0` | USD ceiling. Needs the two price keys below. |
| `cost_per_1k_input` | `0` | Input token price, for the cost ceiling. |
| `cost_per_1k_output` | `0` | Output token price, for the cost ceiling. |

When a budget trips, the request stops at the start of the next round — before
the model call, so an exhausted budget costs nothing — and returns the partial
result along with the name of the key to raise.

Subagents inherit the parent's budget. A fresh budget per subagent would be a
free bypass: delegate, and the limit starts over.

On streaming responses the provider returns no usage object, so tokens are
estimated at roughly 4 characters each. That still bounds a runaway loop; it is
just less precise than the non-streaming path.

### Write blast radius

The permission layer decides *whether* a write is allowed. These bound *how many*
and *how big* — a model looping on `write_file` inside an already-approved turn
is a plausible accident that the permission gate does not catch. Both default to
`0` (disabled).

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `max_writes_per_turn` | `0` | Files one request may write. |
| `max_write_bytes` | `0` | Bytes a single write may contain. |

Checked *before* the permission gate, so the refusal is not something a user can
wave through by mistake, and reset only by the outermost request so a subagent
cannot hand itself a fresh write budget.

## Extension points

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tools_file` | Path to `tools.txt` (the tool registry). |
| `system_file` | Path to `system.md` (base prompt). |
| `user_file` | Path to `USER.md` (persona). |
| `skills_dir` / `agents_dir` | Skill packages and sub-agent profiles. |
| `subagent_max_depth` | Recursion limit for `spawn_subagent`. |
| `default_subagent` | Profile used when none is named. |
| `banner_file` | Custom startup banner. |

## API keys and the `.env` store

Keys and gateway tokens live in `~/.agent8088/.env`, **not** `config.txt`:

```ini
# ~/.agent8088/.env   (mode 0600)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
```

`config.txt` only points at them:

```ini
provider.openai.api_key_env=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

**Migration is automatic and one-time.** On first run, any literal
`provider.*.api_key`, `*_bot_token` or `*_app_token` in `config.txt` is moved
into `.env`, the literal is removed, and an `*_env` pointer is written. It is
idempotent — it will not re-run or lose a key. You'll see:

```
[agent8088] Migrated 2 keys to /home/you/.agent8088/.env
```

### Resolution order

For a provider key, most explicit first:

1. the `.env` key store
2. an explicit `api_key` in `config.txt`
3. `os.environ`

`os.environ` is deliberately **last** so a stray shell export (e.g.
`OPENAI_API_KEY` set for another tool) cannot silently redirect a configured
provider.

Values from any of these sources are redacted from tool output and from the
model's answers, so `cat config.txt` cannot exfiltrate them.

## Environment variables

| Var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENT8088_CONFIG` | Override the config path. |
| `AGENT8088_HOME` | Override the data directory. |
| `AGENT8088_PROVIDER` | Override the active provider. |
| `AGENT8088_PERMISSION` | Starting permission mode. |
| `AGENT8088_SANDBOX` | Override the sandbox backend. |

Setting `AGENT8088_CONFIG=/nonexistent` forces packaged defaults — this is how
the test suite stays hermetic.
