# Tools

[← Wiki index](README.md)

36 built-in tools, registered from `src/agent8088/tools.txt`. The `mode` column
is what the permission layer gates on — see
[Permissions & Security](03-permissions-and-security.md).

`*` optional argument.

## Documents

Reading is automatic: point `read_text` at a `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx` or `.pdf`
and it comes back as text. `.docx` and `.pptx` are parsed with the standard
library; `.xlsx` uses openpyxl and `.pdf` uses pypdf. A scanned PDF with no text
layer says so rather than returning a blank-looking document. Files larger than
`max_document_bytes` (25 MB) are refused.

Long files arrive one page at a time with a header naming the true line count —
pass `offset` to continue, `limit` to change the page size (`read_page_lines`,
default 200). Short files are returned whole with no header.

Writing has two routes. The `documents` skill teaches the agent to write
`python-docx`/`openpyxl`/`python-pptx`/`reportlab` code and run it through
`execute_shell` — the flexible path, and the only one that produces PDFs or
edits an existing file. `create_document` is the deterministic fallback for when
generating that code is unreliable: it takes plain lines rather than code, but
only creates new `.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`.

`create_document` declares `mode=write_text` deliberately. Around a dozen places
key on that mode — the sensitive-file floor, write path zones, plan-only
blocking, plan-audit revert. Sharing the mode means the tool inherits every one
of them instead of needing a parallel set that could drift.

## CAD

Reading is automatic for STEP, BREP, and STL. The isolated CAD worker reopens
the artifact and reports its bounding box, solid count, volume, and topology
validity rather than interpreting it as text.

There is deliberately **no one-shot CAD generation tool**. `create_cad_part`,
`generate_cad_design`, `generate_cad_model`, and the staged `cad_project_*`
workflow were retired: several overlapping CAD routes was the documented cause of
wrong tool selection and oversized single-response programs. The constrained
`gen_step()` generator survives as an internal library — it is the clean-process
replay that `cad_export` gates on — but it is not callable by the model.

CAD generation uses one supervised route. `cad_begin` starts an isolated
build123d-mcp process and seeds editable parameters. Subsequent `cad_execute`
calls add one feature or component at a time to persistent geometry. Measurement,
inspection, validation, snapshot, rollback, and comparison tools operate on that
real state, so later model decisions use observed geometry instead of assumptions.

Agent8088 owns the server process and applies a hard outer deadline. If
OpenCascade hangs or crashes, the process tree is terminated, restarted, and
only successful transactions are replayed. A failed transaction is never added
to recovery history. The model sees a curated CAD surface rather than all
upstream MCP tools, reducing schema and tool-selection noise.

`cad_export` stages STEP and requested STL/3MF plus parameters, reports,
transaction history, canonical `gen_step()` source, and a preview, and publishes
them only after every gate passes: the validity gate on each exported object
(`*` expands to every registered object, because upstream `validate` does not
accept it), a rebuild of the recorded operations in a brand-new server process
whose measured geometry must match the live session exactly, a rebuild of the
canonical source in Agent8088's separate constrained worker where that worker's
policy can run it, and an independent text-to-cad reopen of the STEP. A session
built on imported geometry cannot be rebuilt from parameters alone, so its report
records the constrained replay as not applicable and the clean-process replay
carries the gate. Nothing is published when a gate fails. `validate_cad_model`
can repeat the artifact-level checks later.

`cad_restore` rewinds the session's replayable history to the checkpoint and
rebuilds from it, because upstream `restore_snapshot` rewinds registered objects
but not the execute namespace — without the rebuild the next `part = part - ...`
would silently continue from the geometry that was just rolled back. A supervised
restart re-creates each checkpoint at the point in history it was taken, so
rollback still works after recovery.

During a CAD-generation turn, generic shell and file-writing tools are removed
from the model-visible tool set. The agent receives the real artifacts location,
uses a bare project name, and executes only one stateful CAD operation per model
response. If a response reaches the provider's output ceiling, its unusable
partial source is discarded and the retry returns to `cad_state` or `cad_begin`
before continuing with smaller feature calls. This
avoids shell path guessing, repeated approval loops, and unbounded source
rewrites consuming the model's time or token budget.

`open_cad_viewer` complements deterministic validation with interactive review
of STEP/STP, STL, 3MF, GLB, and DXF artifacts. The managed text-to-cad Viewer
provides an assembly tree, part visibility/focus, display and clipping modes,
exploded layouts, annotations, screenshots, and interactive measurements. Its
server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, receives only the artifact directory, and is
started through the guarded tool rather than shell-generated commands. The
prebuilt Viewer is installed from a commit- and checksum-pinned upstream
archive; development/npm sources are not executed. STEP remains authoritative
because measurements on triangulated formats snap to mesh vertices.

build123d, build123d-mcp, and text-to-cad are pinned in a dedicated Python 3.11
`integrations/cad/venv` environment installed on a best-effort basis by both
platform installers. The same stage installs and smoke-tests the pinned Viewer. A
CAD-stage failure never blocks the core agent, and `/doctor` reports whether
the exact runtime versions are ready. Native `.FCStd` feature trees are not
created; validated STEP is the canonical editable interchange artifact.

PDF is deliberately **not** a `convert_cad` target. A useful 3D-to-PDF result
requires a drawing definition (template, projection, dimensions, and scale),
not a format conversion.

Mutating CAD MCP tools pass Agent8088's normal write approval and workspace
policy, with approval scoped to one design: the first mutating call in a session
asks, and the rest of that design's steps in the same workspace proceed. A new
`cad_begin` or a new user turn asks again. The scope is safe to widen this far
because the cad_* tools cannot run a shell, reach the network, or write outside
the approved workspace. Read-only geometry queries do not prompt. Upstream tools
that look read-only but accept a save path are not exposed directly; Agent8088
supplies their paths internally from the active artifact workspace.

A CAD request does not have to say "CAD": a mechanical design verb plus a
mechanical noun or an explicit millimetre dimension also routes to the supervised
session, so "design a robotic gripper" gets the same contract and the same
bounded toolset as "generate a CAD bracket".

> `git_status`/`git_diff`/`git_log` depend on the sandbox backend: allowed

## Aliases

The model can call tools by natural names; they resolve to the canonical tool:

| Says | Runs |
|---|---|
| `bash`, `sh`, `shell`, `run` | `execute_shell` |
| `search`, `web`, `google` | `web_search` |
| `read`, `cat` | `read_text` |
| `write`, `create_file` | `write_file` |
| `calc`, `eval`, `math` | `calculate` |

## Argument transforms

Some plausible-but-wrong shapes are rewritten rather than rejected — e.g.
`mkdir({path: "x"})` becomes `execute_shell({command: "mkdir x"})`. This is why
the agent recovers instead of looping when the model invents a tool that
*sounds* right.

## Tool modes explained

`mode` is the contract between a tool and the permission layer. Adding a tool to
`tools.txt` with an existing mode inherits that mode's gating automatically.

| Mode | Gated as |
|---|---|
| `read_text` | read — allowed in readonly |
| `write_text` | write — path zones, sensitive + shell-rc floor |
| `shell` | command classifier + sandbox |
| `http_get` / `http_post` | network + SSRF + content wrapping |
| `browser` | network + SSRF |
| `docker` | sandbox |
| `cron` | scheduled side effect |
| `subagent` | recursion-depth guarded |
| `python_eval` | pure computation — allowed in readonly |
| `last_output` | pure recall — allowed in readonly |
| `plan` | the plan-only entry point |
| `introspect` | self-report — allowed in **every** mode; touches no file, socket, or process |
| `mcp` | external MCP tool — see [MCP](07-mcp.md) |
| `skill` | path-confined local text loading for enabled progressive skills |
| `cli_anything` | action-specific catalog, package-change, or host-execution permission checks |

## Adding a tool

`tools.txt` is pipe-delimited:

```
name|description|mode=<mode>|args=a,b|timeout=25
```

HTTP tools take extra fields:

```
url=https://api.example.com/search
headers=Authorization: Bearer {my_api_key};;Content-Type: application/json
body={"q": "{query}"}
filter=.results[]        # jq expression applied to the response
extract=title            # or: return only the page <title>
```

Notes that save time:

- `{placeholders}` interpolate from config *and* tool args. `{query_q}` is the
  URL-encoded variant of `{query}`.
- Headers are split on `;;`, then on the first `:` — so a `User-Agent`
  containing semicolons works fine.
- An unresolved `{placeholder}` produces a message naming the missing key,
  rather than a confusing SSRF error.
- Everything stays behind the SSRF guard, which is exactly why HTTP is a *mode*
  rather than something you'd shell out to `curl` for.

### Disabling a built-in

There is **no `disabled_tools` config key** — the loader has no such filter, so
setting one has no effect. To drop a tool, comment out its line (the parser
skips blank lines and `#`):

```
# browse_page|Load a user-supplied web page…
```

To do it without editing the installed package, copy `tools.txt`, remove the
line, and point config at your copy:

```ini
tools_file=~/.agent8088/tools.txt
```

Either way, confirm it is gone with `/tools` — the registry is what the model is
offered, so a tool absent there cannot be called at all.

## `describe_capabilities`

Ask the agent what it can do and it answers from fact, not from its own reading
of the prompt:

> **you:** what tools and MCP servers do you have?
> **agent:** *(calls `describe_capabilities`)* …

The report is generated from live state — `TOOL_SPECS` grouped by access mode,
`MCP_RUNTIME.statuses` with per-server connection state and tool lists, installed
skills, configured subagents, the resolved sandbox backend, every limit including
the ones **not** set, and the always-on floor. Because it is generated rather
than hand-maintained, it cannot drift from what the agent actually has.

Available on every surface, all from the same function, so a human and the model
never get different answers:

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Model | the `describe_capabilities` tool |
| CLI | `/capabilities` |
| Gateway chat | `/capabilities` |
| MCP client | exposed in the default non-mutating server surface |

It is permitted in **every** permission mode, including `readonly` and
`plan-only`: an agent that cannot say what it can do is least useful exactly when
it is most restricted. Safe to allow because it opens no file, makes no request,
and starts no process — and its output goes through the same secret redaction as
any other tool result, with no system-prompt text in it.

## Inspecting tools at runtime

```
/tools                        # list all with mode, args, description
/capabilities                 # tools + MCP + skills + limits + guardrails
/tool read_text {"filename": "README.md"}   # invoke one directly
```


## Web search backends

`web_search` is one tool with four interchangeable backends, chosen by
configuration rather than by the model picking a per-vendor tool:

| Backend | Role | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| `searxng` | **default** | Docker (`/search setup` provisions it) or an instance URL |
| `ddgs` | **fallback** | nothing — ships with agent8088 |
| `tavily` | optional — **first priority once its key is set** | `TAVILY_API_KEY` in the `.env` store |
| `exa` | optional — **priority once its key is set**, behind `tavily` | `EXA_API_KEY` in the `.env` store |

`web_search_provider` decides which one serves:

- **`auto` (the shipped default)** — at startup, probe and pick the
  highest-priority backend that can actually serve: a keyed `tavily`/`exa`
  first, else `searxng` **if it answers**, else `ddgs`. The winner is then
  pinned for the session. SearXNG has to pass a real liveness probe because a
  pin has no fallback, so pinning a stopped instance would mean no web search.
- **An explicit name** — pins exactly that backend. No auto-selection, no
  fallback. `/search use <name>` writes it.

Adding an API key is the signal to prefer that backend, so a configured
`tavily` or `exa` outranks both keyless backends; with both keys set, `tavily`
goes first. An optional backend whose key is absent stays out entirely.

**`auto` pins rather than staying dynamic, and that is deliberate.**
`web_search_no_prompt=1` only takes effect while a *local* SearXNG is the
effective pin, because approval-free search is safe only when the query cannot
leave your network. So under `auto`: SearXNG up means silent searches; SearXNG
down means `ddgs` serves and each search asks, because those queries do reach a
third party. Silent *and* external is the one combination this cannot produce.
If startup resolution is skipped entirely (an embedder calling the engine
directly), the unresolved value never matches the exemption, so it fails closed
to prompting.

If the chosen backend fails at call time — instance stopped, rate limited — the
next available one serves the request, so a broken primary does not mean "no web
search". The result always names which backend served it, so a silent fallback
is visible.

Because `ddgs` needs no key, no hosting, and no setup, web search works on a
fresh install. Run `/search status` for the live chain, `/search doctor` to
diagnose, and `/search use <backend>` to pin one.

## Pointing web search at a SearXNG

`search_base_url` ships **unset**. Nothing is assumed about your network, so a
fresh install searches through the keyless `ddgs` fallback until you choose an
endpoint. There are three ways to set one.

### 1. Provision a local instance (recommended)

Needs Docker. From the REPL:

```
/search setup
```

That writes a `settings.yml` with JSON output enabled and a random
`secret_key`, starts the container on `127.0.0.1:8888`, waits for the JSON API
to answer, then saves `search_base_url` and allowlists the host for you. Nothing
else to do. If the container never answers, nothing is saved — a backend that
cannot serve must not be recorded, or the chain would try it first on every
search.

To move it off port 8888:

```
searxng_host_port=8888
```

The **host** is not configurable. SearXNG's JSON API has no authentication, so
the container is always published to `127.0.0.1` only — binding it to `0.0.0.0`
would put an open search proxy on your network.

`/search stop` removes the container.

### 2. Point at an instance you already run

Set the endpoint by hand in `config.txt`. It must end at `search?q=` with no
placeholder — the query is appended for you:

```
# on this machine
search_base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8888/search?q=

# elsewhere on your LAN — the host must also be allowlisted
search_base_url=http://192.168.1.10:8888/search?q=
ssrf_allow_hosts=127.0.0.1,localhost,192.168.1.10:8888
```

A private address the agent has not been told about is blocked as internal, which
is why the LAN case needs the second line. Add the port when the instance runs on
one: `ssrf_allow_hosts` entries match `host` or `host:port`.

Your instance must have JSON output enabled — upstream SearXNG **disables it by
default**, and without it every search fails with a parse error. In its
`settings.yml`:

```yaml
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

### 3. Point at a public instance

`https://` is **required** for a public host. Plaintext `http://` is accepted
only for loopback and private addresses, so queries never cross the internet in
the clear:

```
search_base_url=https://searx.example.org/search?q=
```

Most public instances rate-limit or block API clients, so expect HTTP 429 and
keep `ddgs` available as the fallback. Approval-free search is never granted to
a public host, no matter what `web_search_no_prompt` says.

### Verify it

```
/search status    # which backend is pinned right now, and the whole chain
/search doctor    # container state, endpoint, SSRF coverage, JSON check
```

`/search doctor` reports `search_base_url` as `not set (using fallback)` when no
endpoint is configured, which is the normal state on a fresh install.

### Using an API-key backend instead

If you would rather not host anything, add a key to the `.env` store next to
`config.txt` and that backend joins the chain automatically, outranking both
keyless ones:

```
TAVILY_API_KEY=...   # agent-optimized results with citations
EXA_API_KEY=...      # semantic/neural search
```

Keys never go in `config.txt`. `/search setup` prompts for them if you pick one
of those backends.

## How the agent chooses a tool

Tool choice is enforced in three places, each doing only what it is good at.

**The prompt** carries the judgement calls: use the smallest tool that answers
the request, never call one for text you already have (summarizing,
translating, reasoning about readable code, writing), treat MCP tools as
belonging to the system they wrap, and always follow an explicit instruction
over any of these preferences.

**Runtime context** gives the model the current date. Without it there is only
a training cutoff, so "the next election" means whatever was next during
training and an old page reads as current.

**The engine** enforces what a prompt cannot be trusted with:

| Behaviour | What happens |
|---|---|
| Date-qualified queries | A query meaning "as of now" with no year of its own gets the current year appended — or the month, for "today"/"this week". Controlled by `search_date_augmentation` |
| Result dating | Results are stamped with their retrieval date so the model can spot a stale one |
| Repeat searches | A reworded or reordered repeat is answered from the first search's results instead of re-running. A failed or empty search stays retryable |
| Follow-up fetches | After a search succeeds, an *unsolicited* `browse_page`, `curl`-style shell command, or fetch-shaped MCP call is refused |

An **approved plan** lifts the follow-up gate for the rest of that turn. A
plan-mode turn researches with a search and then carries out the approved steps in
the same turn, so the gate would otherwise refuse work the user had just said yes
to — and naming a tool is not how they said it, so the explicit-request escape
below cannot cover it. The exemption ends when the plan's turn does.

Every gate yields to an explicit request: give a URL, name a command, or name
an MCP tool and it runs. The gates only catch tools the model reached for on
its own.
